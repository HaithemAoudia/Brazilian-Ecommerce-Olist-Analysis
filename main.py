    The Brazilian Ecommerce Dataset includes 8 datasets covering different areas of the ecommerce business. To generate 
    a database structure it is key to first understand the business requirement and what the use case of the database is.
    As the goal here is to create a data structure to easily query consumer insights in a scalable way that aligns with 
    the requirements of the Analytics Team, it is clear that the use case here is analytical. Therefore, a dimensional data model 
    rather than a relational data model is chosen as the main database structure to be adopted.
    
    This is due to the following reasons:
    - More scalable for analytics as the data volume and query complexity increases.
    - More optimal query performance and minimizes the number of joins required.
    - Business users can more easily understand the relationships between data.
             
    The Fact_Order_Item is chosen as the central Fact table as it represents the lowest level of granularity in our data.
         To capture the business measures for Olist, Dim_Order, Dim_Product, Dim_Seller, Dim_Customer, Dim_Review and Dim_Payment are
         added as dimensions in the database structure.

             the RFM model as a proxy for overall customer value and the K means clustering algorthim to cluster the customers into distinct group based on their value

         1.	High-value customers are primarily in S√£o Paulo and predominantly purchasing from computer accessories and furniture d√©cor categories, with peak purchasing activity occurring at 2 PM on Thursdays. Olist can roll out membership initiative 
         specilifically tailored towards High Value customer which in turn can increase loyalty and long term sales.
        2.	Customers often pair products from the computer accessories category, indicating strong purchase combinations 
         within this segment. Additionally, items from the largest product category, 
         Bed Bath & Table, are frequently combined with Home Comfort products. Olist can cross sell relevant products
         and improve thier recommendation systems to increase thier average order value (AOV).
        3.	Customers praise the fast delivery and high-quality goods while dissatisfaction arises from delayed deliveries, unresponsive customer service, defective products and wrong product being shipped. Olist can address these customer concerns which
         may increase the number of high value and loyal customers which in turn can improve long term sales and membership initiatives.
